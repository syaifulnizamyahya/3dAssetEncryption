# 3dAssetEncryption

Simple project encrypting 3d assets. Using GLTF as 3d model format. The encrypted object can still be rendered.

There are 2 encryption method in this example :
1. Obfuscating the vertices by applying XOR operations against random number.
2. Obfuscating the vertices by shuffling the vertex component index.
